# Regression-Model

Regression analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow us to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or multiple predictor variables (x). Briefly, the goal of regression model is to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables.
